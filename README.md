# quivers

This is a javascript library intended to do simple computations on quivers and their representation. The reason it is written in javascript is threefold: people can easily use the library in their browser; eventualy, the library could be implemented as a form style website with a user interface to further aid the ease of use; layziness was a factor, considering that the intended use of this library is not to perform computations to the extend where efficiency becomes a significant factor.

In the future, the code may be translated to more suitable languages, or the rewritte to extend existing libraries.
